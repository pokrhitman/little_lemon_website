## 🧩 Features

- **Modern Menu with Interactive Pop-ups**  
  Menu items (appetizers, main dishes, sides, desserts) are rendered as responsive cards with animated nutritional popups, built with a scalable data-driven approach.

- **Quote of the Day Widget**  
  A motivational or culinary quote is shown on the Home page, pulled from a local database (future-proof against broken APIs), with a button for instant new quotes.

- **Sign-Up, Login & Feedback Forms**  
  All forms are interactive, accessible and fully controlled, with real-time validation and success messaging.

- **Dark/Light Theme Toggle**  
  Global theming with persistent theme choice and consistent style application.

- **Reusable, Maintainable Components**  
  Modular approach: all UI blocks (Navbar, Footer, QuoteCard, MenuItem, etc.) are easy to reuse and extend.

- **Advanced React Patterns**  
  Functional components, custom hooks, prop drilling, controlled inputs, modular state management.

- **Polished UI & Clean CSS**  
  Consistent color system, accessible contrast, focus indicators, responsive layout, and modern cards.
